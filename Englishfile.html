    <h1>
        why do people need God?
    </h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p>
    1. Because Humans Long for Meaning<br>
Every person asks: “Why am I here?”<br>
Without God, life can seem random or temporary.<br>
Belief in God gives life a purpose — that we were created for a reason,<br> 
loved by our Creator, and meant to live for something greater than ourselves.<br>
📖 “You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and <br>
our hearts are restless until they rest in You.” — St. Augustine<br>
<br>
<br>
💖 2. Because People Need Love That Never Fails<br>
Human love can be imperfect or temporary.<br>
God’s love is unconditional — it doesn’t depend on success, beauty, or approval.<br>
Many find peace in knowing they are loved completely and eternally.<br>
📖 “Nothing can separate us from the love of God.” — Romans 8:38–39<br>
<br>
<br>
🌿 3. Because People Need Hope<br>
In suffering, loss, or uncertainty, faith in God gives hope that pain is not meaningless.<br>
Believers trust that God can bring good even out of hardship — and that <br>
eternal life awaits beyond death.<br>
📖 “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.” — Psalm 34:18<br>
🧭 4. Because We Need Guidance and Wisdom<br>
<br>
<br>
People struggle to know right from wrong, especially in a confusing world.<br>
God provides moral direction through His Word and Spirit — a compass that <br>
doesn’t change with culture.<br>
📖 “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105<br>
🤝 5. Because We Need Forgiveness<br>
Everyone makes mistakes and feels guilt or shame.<br>
God offers forgiveness and a fresh start through Jesus Christ — something<br> 
we can’t earn by ourselves.<br>
📖 “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us.” — 1 John 1:9<br>
<br>
<br>
🌍 6. Because We Need Belonging<br>
Faith connects people to a spiritual family — a community of love, support, and shared faith.<br>
God designed humans for relationship, both with Him and with one another.<br>
📖 “Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.” — Matthew 18:20<br>

<h1>
    How to be saved?
</h1>
</center>
<center>
    ✝️ 1️⃣ Realize You Need Salvation<br>
Every person has sinned and fallen short of God’s perfect standard.<br>
We cannot save ourselves by good deeds or religion.<br>
📖 “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23<br>
📖 “The wages of sin is death.” — Romans 6:23<br>
👉 Why this matters:<br>
Sin separates us from God. Without forgiveness, we remain spiritually dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
💔 2️⃣ Understand What God Did for You<br>
Because He loves you, God provided the only way of salvation — Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus is God’s Son who came to earth, lived without sin,<br>
died on the cross to take our punishment,<br>
and rose again on the third day.<br>
📖 “God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, <br>
Christ died for us.” — Romans 5:8<br>
📖 “Christ died for our sins… He was buried, and He was raised <br>
on the third day.” — 1 Corinthians 15:3–4<br>
👉 Why this matters:<br>
Only Jesus’ sacrifice can remove sin and reconcile us with God.<br>
<br>
<br>
🕊️ 3️⃣ Repent and Believe the Gospel<br>
To be saved, you must turn away from sin (repent) and trust <br>
in Jesus Christ alone as your Savior and Lord.<br>
📖 “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out.” — Acts 3:19<br>
📖 “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.” — Acts 16:31<br>
👉 What this means:<br>
Not just believing with your head — but trusting with your heart, <br>
surrendering your life to Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
❤️ 4️⃣ Confess and Receive Him Personally<br>
Speak to God in faith — confessing Jesus as Lord and receiving His gift of salvation. <br>
📖 “If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord  <br>
and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead,  <br>
you will be saved.” — Romans 10:9 <br>
👉 You can pray something like this: <br>
“Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner. <br>
I believe You died for my sins and rose again. <br>
I turn from my sin and receive You as my Savior and Lord. <br>
Thank You for forgiving me and giving me eternal life. Amen.” <br>
<br>
<br>
🌿 5️⃣ Live as a New Creation <br>
When you receive Jesus, God gives you the Holy Spirit to guide and strengthen you. <br>
You are forgiven, made new, and adopted into God’s family. <br>
📖 “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.” — 2 Corinthians 5:17 <br>
📖 “To all who received Him… He gave the right to become children of God.” — John 1:12 <br>
<br>
<br>
👉 Next steps: <br>
Read the Bible daily <br>
Pray and talk with God <br>
Join a community of believers (church) <br>
Share your faith with others <br>
